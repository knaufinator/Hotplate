# Vevor Hotplate main board ESP32 replacement

Vevor hot plate full motherboard replacement mod with esp32,.. why???... because i broke mine and i wanted to still use it all components are standard and can be interfaced. 2 temps (pt100,k),a few rotory encoders and a dc motor for the magnetic stirrer.

learning to use ESP-IDF 5.2, with lvgl 8.3
